# Web-Scraping-and-Data-Analysis-Falcon-9-Launch-Records

Web Scraping and Data Analysis of Falcon 9 Launch Records
This project uses Python to webscrape the launch records from the Wikipedia page "List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches". The launch records are then saved as a Pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file. The CSV file can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Requirements
Python 3
BeautifulSoup
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
## Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies.
Open the Jupyter notebook webscraping.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Run the cells in the notebook to scrape the launch records from Wikipedia.
The CSV file will be saved in the data directory.
## Data Analysis
The CSV file can be used for further analysis or visualization. Here are some ideas:

Plot the number of Falcon 9 launches over time.
Analyze the success rate of Falcon 9 launches.
Compare the performance of Falcon 9 launches to other launch vehicles.
